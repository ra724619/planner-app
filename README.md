# Description
It is a work hour event planner. It helps to keep the record of past, present, and future events in the working hour (9AM-5PM).

# Usage
The event planner has nine time blocks (9 AM-5 PM). Once the page is loaded, it checks the current time, and the time block will change its colour accordingly. It will change to grey for the past time, red for the present time, and green for the future time. User can input event in the coloured area, and save event by clicking the save button. Once the event is saved, it will store in the user's browser's local storage. When user refreshes the page, they can check the saved event, and see a clear event button at the bottom of the calendar. If needed, the user can click the clear event button and clear the event from the calender.
